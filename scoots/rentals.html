            </div>
            <div class="scooter">
                <h3>Honda Dio</h3>

                <h3>Honda PCX150</h3>
                <p>This is one bad scooter. When we say bad, we mean perfectly good in every way. This baby has a 149cc engine that can take you anywhere you want to go. It also has a capacity for 2 people and can handle any terrain you encounter out there on the road to adventure!</p>

                <h3>Honda Pioneer 1000</h3>
                <p>If you like to tear it up on the trails with your friends, this is the vehicle you need. There are many forest/jungle trails around Cozumel and Playacara, and this beast can handle them all. If you don't mind having all the freedom in the world, we would recommend getting this off-road vehicle.</p>

                <h3>4-Door</h3>
                <p>This is the apex of human innovation. This will allow you to be the king of any road you travel on. With ice cold A/C and 5 seats, there is nothing that will stop you other than your own limitations.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="jeep">
                <h3>2-Door</h3>
                <p>This vehicle is okay. Not the best, not the worst. If you are going to spend money on a jeep you might as well get the one with A/C. We won't judge you if you get this one though... much.</p>
